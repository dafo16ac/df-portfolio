<h1 align="center"> Portfolio </h1>

I am Davide Fogarolo. Graduate in Finance with a background in Philosophy. Due to my passion for data and data interpretation, I have been autonomously expanding my knowledge and dexterity in data science/engineering and then worked as junior data scientist. 
Here I present my *Portfolio* where I provide an overview of and respective links to my projects.

Feel free to contact me on LinkedIn, at [Davide Fogarolo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davide-fogarolo/)
