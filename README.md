<h1 align="center"> Portfolio </h1>

I am Davide, graduate in Finance with a background in Philosophy. I have worked as Junior Data Scientist in the Maritime Industry for almost a year now.

Lifelong learning has always been of the utmost importance to me. That is why I have started to expand (always increasing, never enough) my knowledge and dexterity in providing the most accurate interpretation and presentation of data.

Here is my *Portfolio* with an overview of and respective links to my projects in Data Science - Engineering.

It would be my pleasure to get in contact with you to further discuss ideas and implementation steps. 

Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn at [Davide Fogarolo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davide-fogarolo/).
