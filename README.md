<h1 align="center"> Portfolio </h1>

I am Davide, graduate in Finance with a background in Philosophy. Due to my passion for data and data interpretation, I have been autonomously expanding my knowledge and dexterity in data science/engineering and then worked as junior data scientist. 

Here is my *Portfolio* where I provide an overview of and respective links to my projects.

It would be my pleasure to get in contact with you so that we can further discuss ideas and implementation techniques. Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn at [Davide Fogarolo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davide-fogarolo/).
