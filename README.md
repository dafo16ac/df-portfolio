<h1 align="center"> Portfolio </h1>

I am Davide, graduate in Finance with a background in Philosophy. Due to my passion for data interpretation, I am autonomously expanding my knowledge in data science. 

Here is my *Portfolio* with an overview of and respective links to my projects in Data Science - Engineering.

It would be my pleasure to get in contact with you to further discuss ideas and opportunities. Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn at [Davide Fogarolo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davide-fogarolo/).
